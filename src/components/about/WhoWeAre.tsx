            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">From 19 years of industry knowledge, Property Management companies have grown accustomed to dealing with vendors in the service industry and have received just that: a "service". While we can't remember every service that we have received in our lives, we can recall almost every memorable Experience we've had.</p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Our desired result at Frost Hospitality Experience is to provide an Experience that is molded to fulfill ALL of our residents' everyday lifestyle needs. From the moment residents tour the community, to the time they pick up move-in keys, they will feel reassured that made the right decision to call your community, Home.
